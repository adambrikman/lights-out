<!-- DESCRIPTION/ -->
This app is a recreation of the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)">classic Lights Out game released in 1995 by Tiger Electronics</a>.

The game consists of a 5 x 5 grid. Of the twenty-five available cells, a random number of them are pre-lit. The objective of the game is to have all cells 'turned-off.'

Each user gesture impacts the cell clicked on as well as all adjacent cells. Additionally, each gesture will 'flip' the selected cell and adjacent cells. (i.e. If the cells are lit, they will be turned off and vice versa).

After you win, the game board will disappear and "You Win!" will be displayed as well as a button to play again.

Have fun!
